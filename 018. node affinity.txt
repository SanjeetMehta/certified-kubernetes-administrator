Node affinity:  It helps to schedule the pod on a particular node. We can provide advanced options like or or not.
    Types:
        Available:
            requiredDuringSchedulingIngoredDuringExecution
            preferredDuringSchedulingIngoredDuringExecution
        Planned
            requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution

    these doesn't helps us to restric a pod from scheduling, it only helps to send a particular pod to a particular node,
    i.e pods with affinity set can only land on node having the same label.

kubectl commands:
    kubectl label nodes <node_name> <lavel_key>=<label_value> (labels a given node)
    kubectl label nodes node01 name-  (removes lable from a node)
