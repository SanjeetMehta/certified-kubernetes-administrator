Node Selector: It helps to schedule the pod on a particular node. We have to label the node for achieving this.
     We cannot provide advanced options like or or not while selecting selectors.

Pod definition:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: myapp-pod
    labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
    nodeSelector:
        size: Large
    
kubectl commands:
    kubectl label nodes <node_name> <lavel_key>=<label_value> (labels a given node)
