Kubernetes scheduler can have multiple scheduler at the same time. We can have a custom scheduler running alongside k8s scheduler.
When creating a deployment or a pod we can instruct k8s to use a particular scheduler.


Pod with custom scheduler definition:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: nginx
spec:
    containers:
    - image: nginx
      name: nginx
    schedulerName: my-custom-scheduler

kubectl commands:
    kubectl get events (and look for scheduled events)
    kubectl logs my-custom-scheduler --name-space=kube-system
