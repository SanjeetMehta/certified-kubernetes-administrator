Pods: Application containers are encapsulated into a k8s object called Pods. A pod is a single instance of an application. It is 
    the smallest object which we can create in a k8s.

    All the containers inside the pods are on the same network, that means they can access each other using localhost:port.

Pod definition:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: myapp-pod
    labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx

kubectl commands:
    kubectl get all (list all the created object at once)
    kubectl create -f <file_name of the definition> 
    kubectl get pods (lists all pods)
    kubectl describe pod <pod_name> (displays all the details of a pod)
    kubectl delete pod <pod_name> (delete a pod)
    kubectl delete --all pod (delete all pods)
    kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --port=80 --restart=Never (Creates pod directly)
