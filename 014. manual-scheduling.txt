How scheduling works:
    Scheduler looks for the nodeName property in pods configutation and then deploys the pod to the node matching this property.

Pod definition:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: myapp-pod
    labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
    nodeName: node-name

NodeName can only be provided at the pod creation time. But if pod is already created and you want to assign it to a node in that
case k8s doesn't allow to modify the NodeName property.

To assign a already running pod to a node we have to create a pod-binding object and make a POST api call.

curl --header "COntent-Type:application/json" --request POST --data '{converted yaml files as JSON}'
http://$SERVER/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/$PODNAME/binding

Pod Binding definition:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Binding
metadata:
    name: nginx
target:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: node
    name: node02
