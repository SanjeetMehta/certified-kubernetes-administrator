Static pods: These are pods directly created by kubelet on a node. Kubelet looks at the manifest folder and reads a configuration from there. 
    All control plane components are run as static pods in k8s.
    Node name is appended to the static pod's name.

pods created by static pods and daemonsets are not managed by scheduler.

kubectl command:
    kubectl run --restart=Never --image=busybox static-busybox --dry-run=client -o yaml --command -- sleep 1000 > /etc/kubernetes/manifests/static-busybox.yaml
