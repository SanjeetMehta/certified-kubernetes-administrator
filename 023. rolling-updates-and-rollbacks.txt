When we first create a ddeployment it triggeres a rollout. A new rollout creates a new deployment revision.

Deployment Strategy.
    Recreate: first delete the old pod and the create a new one.
    Rolling update: first create the pod and then delete the old one. This is the default strategy.

kubectl commands:
    kubectl create -f deployment-definition.yml
    kubctl get deployments
    kubectl apply -f deployment-definition.yml
    kubctl set image deployment/<deployment_name> nginx=nginx:1.9.1
    kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment_name> (status of rollout)
    kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment_name> (rivisions and history of rollout)
    kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment_name> (rollback the deployment)
