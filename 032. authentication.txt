Different users accessing the cluster: Admins, Developers, Application End users, Bots

Application End users-> This is managed by the application and not the kubernetes.

Types of kubernetes users.
    1. Users (Admin and Developers) -> Kubernetes don't manage it, k8s relies on some 3rd party service.
        All user access is managed by the kube-apiserver. Kube-apiserver authenticates the request before processing it.
        There are different authentication mechanisms that can be configured.
            - static password file -> Create a csv files containing username and password and use it. (Not recommended)
            - static token file -> Create a csv files containing username and token and use it. (Not recommended)
            - using certificates
            - identity services (like LDAP, etc.)

    2. Bots (Service accounts) -> K8s manages these.
