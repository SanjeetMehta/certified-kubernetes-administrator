Different apis available
curl https://kube-master:6443/version -> returns version

curl https://kube-master:6443/api/v1/pods -> returns list of pods 

/version
/api
/apis
/metrics
/healthz
/logs

These apis have different purposes, some are used for monitoring, some for logs, etc.


APIs responsible for cluster functionality
/api -> core group
/apis -> named group

core group: this contains the core functionality
/api/v1 
 - namespaces, pods, replication controller, events, endpoints, nodes, bindings, PV, PVC, configmaps, secrets, services

 named group (going forward, new functionalities are going to be added in named groups):
 /apis
    - /apps (api group)
        - /v1 
            - /deployments, /replicasets, /statefulsets (resource group)
                - each resource has set of actions associated with them like list, get, create, delete, update, watch (these are known as verbs)
    - /extensions (api group)
        - /v1
            - /networkpolicies
    - /networking.k8s.io (api group)
    - /storage.k8s.io (api group)
    - /authentication.k8s.io (api group)
    - /certificate.k8s.io (api group)
        - /v1
            - /certificatessigningrequests (resource group)


kubectl commands:
    kubectl proxy (launches a proxy service locally and uses kubeconfig file to access cluster)


kube proxy != kubectl proxy

kube proxy -> it is used to enable communication b/w pods and services accross different nodes in cluster
kubectl proxy -> This is http proxy service created by kubectl utility to access kube api server
