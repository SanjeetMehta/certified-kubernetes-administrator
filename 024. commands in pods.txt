Commands are the entry point into a container.

In docker image.
CMD: This command is used to start a docker container when we do a docker run.
    This can be changed during docker start by providing a command during docker run.
    This should be provided in JSON format.

    docker run <image_name> command

ENTRYPOINT: This command is used to start a docker container when we do a docker run.
    However, this cannot be changed unlike CMD command douring docker run, all the parameters provided during docker run
    are appended to the command provided.
    This should be provided in JSON format.

    docker run <image_name> value_to_be_appended

    To override a ENTRYPOINT command using following command

    docker run --entrypoint <command> <image_name> <value>

If we provide both CMD and ENTRYPOINT then ENTRYPOINT appends value which is provided in CMD.
This should be provided in JSON format.

eg:
FROM Ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
CMD ["5]

during runtime: sleep 5

          args: ["10"]   # It overrides the CMD command inside docker file.
