Container runtime interface:
    It is a standard that defines how an orchestration solution like k8s can communicate with container runtime engines
    like docker. So if in the future and new container runtime interface is developed they can simply follow CRI
    standards and that new container runtime could work with k8s without being dependent on k8s.

Container Network interface:
    To extend support for different newtowrking solutions the container newtowrking interface was introduced.

Container Storage interface (This is universal standard):
    This was developed to support multiple storage solutions.

    CSI should provide RPC calls for, create volume, delete volume, and ControllerPublishVolume.
