ETCD: It is a distributed reliable key-valu store that is simple, secure, and fast.

In kubernetes, this datastore holds info about the cluster such as nodes, pods, configs, secrets, accounts, role, bindings, etc. Kubectl command gets information
from ETCD server.
Every change to the cluster such as adding additional nodes, deploying pods or replica sets are updated in ETCD server.
