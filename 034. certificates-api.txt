Certificites API
We can send a certificate signing request directly to kubernetes through an API call. This time when a administrator receives a certificate signing request instead of doing it manually
he creates a kubernetes api object called CertificateSigningRequest.

Steps for signing:
1. User first creates a key and generates a certificate signing request using the key with her name on it. 
    openssl genrsa -out jane.key 2048
2. Sends this request to the administrator.
3. Then administrator takes the key and generates a CertificateSigningRequest object.

Yaml file for CertificateSigningRequest:

apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
kind: CertificateSigningRequest
metadata:
    name: jane
spec:
    groups:
    - system:authenticated
    signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
    usages:
    - digital signature
    - key encipherement
    - server auth
    request:
        encoded request message generated using base64.  --> cat jan.csr | base64

kubectl commands:
    kubectl get csr (Lists all the certificate)
    kubectl certificate approve jane (approve the certificate)
    kubectl get csr jane -o yaml (shows certificate in a yaml format which is encoded in base64 format echo "abc..." | base64 --decode)
    kubectl certificate deny agent-smith (denies the certificate request)
