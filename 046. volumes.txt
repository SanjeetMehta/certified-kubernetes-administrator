Volumes:
    Docker container are transient in nature, which means they are only meant to last for a short period of time.
    Data is destroyed along with the container. To persist data processed by the containers we attach a volume to the container
    when they are created. The data processed by the container is now placed in this volume there by retaining it 
    permanently. Even if the container is deleted, the data generate or processed by it remains.

    Data generated by k8s pod are stored in volumes, and even after the pod is delted the data remains.
