Controller Manager: It continously monitors the state of various components within the system and works towards bring the whole 
    system to the desired functioning state.

    Eg of controllers:
    Node Controller: Responsible for monitoring the status of nodes and taking necessary actions to keep the application running.
    It uses kube-api-server to do that. It checks the status of the node every 5 seconds. 
    If node-controller doesn't receives the heartbeat within those 5 seconds it marks the node as unreachable, but it waits for 
    40sec before marking the node as unreachable.
    After a node is marked as unreachable it gives it 5mins to come back up. If it doesn't then it removes the pod  assigned to that
    node and provisions them onto healthy ones if the pods are a part of replica set.

    Replication controller: Responsible for monitoring the status of replicasets and ensuring that the desired number of pods are
    available at all times within the set. If a pod dies it creates a another one.

Kube-Controller-Manager: It is a proces which has all the controllers.
